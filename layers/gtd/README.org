* Description
This spacemacs layer is based on the web document "[[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text!]]" by Bernt Hansen. AFAIK, his document is the most comprehensive tutorial you could find on the Internet. It is very helpful for those who want to learn org-mode for GTD.

The [[file:org-mode.org][original document]] is also included, though some settings here may be different from the documented version. I modified it a bit to make it fit in with the Spacemacs layer frame.

*IMPORTANT* You'd better put this layer behind org layer, otherwise it will increase launch time significantly. I haven't figured out why. Any help will be appreciated.
